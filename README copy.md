The [Bechdel Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test) is a famous test for content to see if there are at least two characters who are women, that talk to each other, and the conversation is on a topic other a male character. This project explores more about the Bechdel test through a dataset offered by [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-03-09).
