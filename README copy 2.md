## Mini-Project 2

This project was made to discover interactive plots, spatial visualizations, and model visualizations. I chose to use [Florida black bear capture locations](https://geodata.floridagio.gov/datasets/myfwc::fl-black-bear-capture-locations/explore?location=28.241059%2C-83.859859%2C7.61) offered by the [Florida Geospatial Open Data Portal](https://geodata.floridagio.gov/). The focus of this analysis was looking at the age and capture reason of nuisance black bears.
